# <a name="installation"></a> Installation

Axis3D can be installed into your project in various ways. Axis3D is
published to [npm][npm/axis3d], [released on Github][releases], and
installable with package managers like [yarn][yarn] and [npmi][npmi].

Follow the [installation guide](install.md) for a detailed approach to
installing Axis3D into your project. You're probably fine with the
following:

```sh
$ npm install --save axis3d
```

or

```sh
$ yarn add axis3d
```

# <a name="hello-world"></a> Hello World

The following [hello world example](hello-world.md) demonstrates rendering a
green box to the screen. A `canvas` is created with a `webgl` context and
automatically appended to the `body` DOM element.

<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>

<pre lang="js">
frame(({time}) => {
  camera({rotation}, () => {
    material({color: [0, 1, 1, 1]}, () => {
      box()
    })
  })
})
</pre>

    </td>
    <td><img src="assets/hello-world.png"></td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

# <a name="concepts"></a> Concepts

Axis3D provides a simple, functional, and "stateless" API for describing
graphical components. Everything is a **function**. Everything is a
***[Command](api/Command.md)***. Commands are created with a core state that
is used when inputs are not provided when invoked. Commands provide stateless
operations based on some input to provide some output.

Commands also
* [collect input](concepts.md#input)
* [infer lighting](concepts.md#lighting),
* [infer scene hierarchy](concepts.md#scene-hierarchy])
* and [more](api/index.md)

Please read [Concepts](concepts.md) for more information.
